# Self-Supervised-Learning-of-River-Morphology
This repository contains code and resources for the project "Self-Supervised Learning of River Morphology with Visual Pretext Tasks" by Mark J. van der Pijl at Utrecht University. The project explores using self-supervised learning models to recognize river morphology from unannotated geographical data.
